<preview><p>In online marketing, a shopping cart is a piece of e-commerce software on a
    web server that allows visitors to an Internet site to select items for eventual purchase,
    analogous to the American English term "shopping cart". The website allows online shopping
    customers to accumulate a list of items for purchase, described metaphorically as “placing
    items in the shopping cart” or “add to cart”. [2]Upon checkout, the website typically
    calculates a total for the order, including shipping and handling (i.e. postage and packing)
    charges and the associated taxes, as applicable.
    These web apps typically provide a means of capturing a client's payment information,
    but in the case of a credit card they rely on the software module of the secure gateway
    provider, in conjunction with the secure payment gateway, in order to conduct secure
    credit card transactions online.
    The organization structure or form of an organization has evolved in order to perform
    the various roles of the organization and also to provide the services efficiently and
    effectively. Organizations are usually organized according to the functions they
    perform to the extent possible so that the company can run smoothly. E-zone
    International Pvt. Ltd. also has a functional organization structure. The structure
    facilitates all the functions carried out by the whole organization. The company has
    departments to facilitate the business process which also has good coordination
    amongst each other.
